    <p>
      {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      The DAAZ project helps to promote awareness among controllers and processors of their obligations under the GDPR.
      The implementation of that project is part of a public-interest mission which falls to the CNPD on the basis of
      Article 57(1)(d) of the GDPR.

      {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      The anonymity of users is preserved thanks to a unique identifier automatically generated at the first connection.
      The CNPD and its partner the LHC-NC3 (Luxembourg House of Cybersecurity, National Cybersecurity Competence Center)
      are therefore unable to identify the user as part of their training journey.
      {% endblocktranslate %}

      {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      However, if a user requests support from the CNPD (via the address <a
        href="mailto:daaz@cnpd.lu)">daaz@cnpd.lu</a>), personal data (name, surname and email address of the data
      subject) will be processed in order to be able to respond to them. <span class="text-danger"> Users' attention is
        drawn to the fact that they should only provide daaz@cnpd.lu with the information necessary to process their
        request. </span>
